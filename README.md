# Cardiio
A Basic Health Monitoring as per requirement for my school final year project. What this app does is essentially tracks your heart and oxygen levels using a arduino board which is linked to the Google Firebase which is then linked to the app that is also linked to Google Firebase. I've included the admin logins if u want to use it, test it, improve it.
